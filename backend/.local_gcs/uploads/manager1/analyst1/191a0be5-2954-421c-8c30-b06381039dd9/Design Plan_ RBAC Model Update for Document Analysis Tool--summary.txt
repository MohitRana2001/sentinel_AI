This document outlines a plan to update the Document Analysis Tool with a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, replacing the old station/district/state scheme. The new system introduces three roles: Admin (user management), Manager (team oversight), and Analyst (document analysis). Each role has specific permissions and data access scopes, enforced at both API and data levels. The system architecture is client-server, with a React frontend (Shadcn UI) and a Python backend (FastAPI/Flask). Key backend services include Authentication & RBAC, User Management, Document Processing (OCR, summarization using LLMs), Knowledge Graph (Neo4j), and Chat. The SQLite database schema will be redesigned to support RBAC. The implementation roadmap involves iterative development, testing, and migration of existing data to the new schema. This update aims to enhance security, manageability, and user experience.
