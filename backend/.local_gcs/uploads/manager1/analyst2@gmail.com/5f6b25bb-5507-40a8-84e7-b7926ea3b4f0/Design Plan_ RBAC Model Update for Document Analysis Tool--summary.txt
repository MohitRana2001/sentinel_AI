This document outlines a plan to update a Document Analysis Tool with a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model featuring Admin, Manager, and Analyst roles. The goal is to replace the existing access scheme with a hierarchical system governing data access and user management.

The new RBAC model defines distinct permissions: Admins manage users, Managers oversee Analysts and their data, and Analysts analyze their own documents. The system architecture follows a client-server model with a React frontend and a Python backend, leveraging SQLite, Neo4j, and Redis for storage, knowledge graphs, and caching, respectively.

The document details the database schema, backend services for authentication, user management, and document processing (including OCR, summarization, translation, and knowledge graph extraction), and frontend component designs. It includes sequence flows, a migration plan for existing data, and a phased implementation roadmap. This upgrade prioritizes security, data segregation, and tailored user experiences, integrating analytical features within the new RBAC framework.
